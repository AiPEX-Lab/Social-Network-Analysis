      We would like to debrief you on the true nature of the videos. The primary objective of the study is to disseminate doctored/machine altered and authentic videos via a social media network to study the impact of spread of mis-information and the ability of humans to readily identify doctored media versus the authentic counter parts. The study you have completed contains authentic and doctored media in a 50:50 ratio. Please re-verify all the facts and do not assume any or all information youâ€™ve been exposed to as that retrieved from a valid source.
