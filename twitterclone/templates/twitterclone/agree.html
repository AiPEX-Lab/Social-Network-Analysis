      We are conducting an academic study about social networks. We are looking to understand how social relationships in social networks evolve over time. Your tasks are simple. Please view media content posted in the timeline and share your views, if any. You can like or repost the videos posted to become popular and have users follow you. You can follow other MTurk users or be followed by other MTurk users. Randomly following users or asking users to follow you can result in a decrease in your credibility score. You stand a chance to win <strong>$50</strong> for having the <strong>highest credibility score</strong> and another <strong>$50</strong> if you have the <strong>most number of followers. All activity in the site will be recorded and reviewed prior to approving the HIT</strong>. Select the link below to complete the survey. At the end of the survey, you will receive a code to paste into the box below to receive credit for taking part in the study.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Make sure to leave this window open as you complete the survey.</strong> You may login to the social site any number of times using the account credentials you create during sign-up. When you are finished, you will return to this page to paste the code into the box.

    <p class="font-weight-bold">We are asking you to be in a research study.  This form gives you information about the research. </p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">Whether or not you take part is up to you. You can choose not to take part. You can agree to take part and later change your mind. Your decision will not be held against you. </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Why is this research study being done?</p>

        <p>The objective of this project is to transform large scale social media networks into dynamic, data-driven sensing systems that model and predict the social interactions and therein the underlying dynamics. The focus of the study team is to acquire, store, and synthesize disparate data types (i.e., textual, image, temporal and geospatial) generated within large scale social media networks in order to gain a fundamental understanding of how the various forms of media are shared amongst users. By taking part in the research study, your responses to the posted social media will be collected and will be utilized in developing real-world population models to better understand the social dynamics within social media networks.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">What will happen in this research study?</p>

        <p>In the Amazon Mechanical Turk system, the study team developed website will be hosted for you to sign-up to create an account. The account is similar to that of a Facebook/Twitter account which will only ask you to create a username and password to sign-in. The website will not ask you to enter your name, email id nor upload a profile picture which is typically observed in most social media sites. Once you sign-in you will have the ability to follow/unfollow or make friends with other users who have signed up in a similar manner. You can scroll through the main page of the website to watch audio-visual content posted by the study team. Content can either be visual only or audio and visual in nature. In addition to watching the content, you can post your comments, share a post, like/dislike the posts. The website will be functional for a maximum of 4 hours. All your responses will be collected in the background. Once the stipulated time limit has been reached or if you wish to end your session you will need to click on “Code for mturk” button on the website. Once you click on the option, you will be re-directed to a survey page following which a Mturk code will be auto-generated for you to enter in the Mturk site to get paid. You may choose to skip the questions if you are not willing to provide any responses.</p>
